## Introduction

SmartYatra is an innovative Public Transport Digitization System designed to
modernize urban bus transit services. By leveraging real-time technology, the
system enhances operational efficiency, reduces delays, and improves the overall
passenger experience. SmartYatra includes two key panels:

- **Driver Panel**: Enables real-time bus tracking, fare management, and route
  optimization based on live traffic updates.
- **Passenger Panel**: Provides live bus location tracking, optimal route
  suggestions, estimated arrival times, and contactless fare payment via QR
  codes.

## Problem Statement

Public bus systems often suffer from inefficiencies like uncertain arrival
times, poor route optimization, manual fare collection, and a lack of
transparency, leading to reduced passenger satisfaction and increased
operational costs.

## Objectives

1. **Real-Time Tracking**: Allow passengers to monitor live bus locations.
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Enable transport operators to manage routes, traffic,
   and fare collection.
3. **Route Optimization**: Suggest alternative routes to drivers based on
   traffic conditions.
4. **Digital Payments**: Implement QR code-based fare collection to reduce
   errors.
5. **Passenger Dashboard**: Provide estimated bus arrival times and fare
   details.
6. **Dynamic Notifications**: Inform passengers of delays or route changes in
   real-time.
7. **Data Analytics**: Track trends and improve future transport decisions.

## Features
